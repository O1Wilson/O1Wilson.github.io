                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                    This project was my first dive into OpenGL. I built a simple rendering pipeline that progressed from drawing basic shapes to displaying fully lit and textured 3D models. While it's not a full "engine," it helped me get familiar with the core components of real-time rendering. I've been exposed to computer visualization concepts before (more on that later), so this was a really fun project to actually put all my learning to good use. This project also branched into another side project intended solely for 3D models (made from blender).

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        I started with rendering simple primitives: a triangle, then a square, and finally a cube. This helped me get a handle on OpenGL’s VAO, VBO, and EBO system. It's also where I wrote my first Vertex and Fragment shaders for OpenGL. I had written shaders before (hlsl) inside Unity's scriptibal pipeline, and GLSL is mostly the same, but nonetheless it was really fun seeing how customizable you can get with no limiting factor like Unity. I also got to apply some cool math in this portion, where I manipulated my objects with rotation equations using transformation matrices, which I learned from a Graphics Book by Fletcher Dunn.

                            Next, I added a camera system with basic movement + zoom controls. This made navigating the scene possible and laid the groundwork for interacting with 3D space. It was cool seeing how OpenGL has so much support for Input mapping, which was something I was not expecting going into this project.

                            Once I had geometry and movement in place, I added texture support. This included loading images, mapping TextureCoords correctly, and testing with multiple textured cubes. I messed around with a new library stbi_image by Sean Barret. And I learned about Mipmaps and Texture Filtering. I also got to do more work with shaders here, as now I could use the TextureCoords in the color processing.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        This was by far my favourite part of the project, which is probably reflected by just how long this text is. I learned a ton about all the many ways lighting can influence an object. Pretty soon after I implemented a basic Phong lighting model, which I learned all about ambient, diffuse, and specular lights. This was a massive highlight for me, as I am obsessed with math, and the calculations required for these lights are so intriguing and intuitive, I could write a whole essay about how much I loved the math behind these techniques, but I'll save you the time. I spent a ton of time messing around with different values to simulate different materials, which can be found <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/cours/opengl/materials.html" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">here</a>. After that worked, I added lighting maps (Diffuse, and Specular) to my textures, this really opened my eyes on whats possible with materials and this will be my new norm for creating custom textures. I then extended the project to support directional light, point lights, and spotlights—all active in one scene, this again was really fun as I got to delve more into all the linear algebra involved in lighting calculations. Like I said at the start, this portion of the project was absolutely a blast, and lighting is by far my most favorite part of programming.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Finally, I integrated another library: Assimp to load external 3D models. This allowed me to render more complex assets with their own defined vertices, faces, meshes and materials. This part was actually pretty straight foward for me, as I had already built up a lot of foundations in the project beforehand. It did involve me making two new classes. I even got to add some pretty advanced stuff in here like tangent-space normal mapping and vertex skinning, but I never got to utilize them.

                        Even though this was my first OpenGL project, I had a solid foundation going in. I’d already read <em>3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development</em> (Fletcher Dunn) and <em>Foundations of Game Engine Development</em> by Eric Lengyel, as well as a strong theoretical understanding of linear algebra from Gilbert Strang's textbooks. Those books helped a lot with the math side of things.

                        Throughout the project, I followed the LearnOpenGL tutorials. Thanks to the reading I’d done beforehand, the material clicked pretty quickly, and I was able to apply it in my own setup without just copying the code.

                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"> All the code for this project is available on my GitHub repository, including the full source, shaders, and supporting assets. You can actually follow along with how I built each part of the renderer from the ground up, step by step by checking out the Commit Graph. It’s a pretty honest snapshot of how I approached the project and how it evolved over time.<br><br>You can check it out here:
