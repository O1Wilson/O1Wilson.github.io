                I started out in the music world, but over time, I found myself getting more and more drawn to math and programming. What started as curiosity quickly became something I wanted to pursue seriously. For the past five years, I've been focused on growing as a developer — learning new tools, tackling bigger projects, and building a solid understanding of how things work under the hood. I'm especially interested in graphics, AI, and game development, but more than anything, I just enjoy solving problems and creating things that feel meaningful. If you're curious about what I've been working on, feel free to check out my projects or reach out.

                Music has been a major part of my life for over 10 years. I started on alto saxophone and eventually picked up guitar and piano. These days, I play all three saxophones (alto, tenor, bari), guitar, bass, piano, and a bit of violin. I'm especially into jazz and freeform styles, and most of what I play falls somewhere between fusion, funk, and rock with strong jazz influence. Aside from music, I have a deep appreciation for art abstract and classical works in particular. And while I touch on this in my technical sections, it's worth saying: I really enjoy math. I often spend free time working through math problems for fun.

            <p class="mt-4">
                If it doesn't become abundantly obvious from the rest of this page — I really love graphics programming. It's been one of the most rewarding areas I've explored in tech so far. For me, it hits a perfect balance between high-level math, deep problem-solving, and creative freedom. Whether I'm working with OpenGL, Unreal, or just studying it in general, I always feel fully locked in. Out of everything I've tried in this field, graphics was the only one to pull me in this much.

        <p class="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            I started learning C# back in 2020 through Unity. For a while, it was the only language I used — Unity was a great engine, and I hadn't explored much outside of it yet. I even got into Unity's Scriptable Rendering Pipeline, which used HLSL (basically C# with shaders). Later in 2024, I landed an internship at Bioworld, a merchandising company, where I built an AI for generating art used on T-shirts. That project exposed me to Python, Flask, and generative AI, and for a while I thought AI might be my full-time path, as I fell in love with the mathematics behind it. That was until I found graphics, I've completly shifted my focus toward graphics programming in C++, especially in OpenGL and Vulkan. I've been diving deep into rendering, lighting, and high level mathematics and it's been the most exciting and challenging work I've done so far. I've been completely enveloped by the world of graphics, and I love every minute spent working with it. Thus C++ has become my main focus, as its the primary coding language used for Graphics and I feel more confident than ever in my knowledge of math and computers. This journey into graphics has truly accelerated my understanding of the science behind computers and rendering, and I will love to see where it takes me!

        <p class="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            My experience with Unreal Engine and Unity comes from several solo projects and prototypes over the years. I've spent a lot of time learning how to write shaders, both for visual effects and performance. In Unity, I've worked with compute shaders and the job system to get things running smoothly, especially on lower-end hardware. In Unreal, I've been getting comfortable with the rendering pipeline and how to tweak materials and lighting to get the look I want without killing performance. I'm really drawn to the low-level side of graphics, but these engines allow me to express my creative side much easier, which is a fun aspect.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Right now, I'm diving deeper into real-time rendering and engine internals — things like forward+ rendering, GPU culling, and memory management in C++. I've also been keeping an eye on modern graphics APIs like Vulkan, just to understand how things work under the hood.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                    This project was my first dive into OpenGL. I built a simple rendering pipeline that progressed from drawing basic shapes to displaying fully lit and textured 3D models. While it's not a full "engine," it helped me get familiar with the core components of real-time rendering. I've been exposed to computer visualization concepts before (more on that later), so this was a really fun project to actually put all my learning to good use. This project also branched into another side project intended solely for 3D models (made from blender).

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        I started with rendering simple primitives: a triangle, then a square, and finally a cube. This helped me get a handle on OpenGL's VAO, VBO, and EBO system. It's also where I wrote my first Vertex and Fragment shaders for OpenGL. I had written shaders before (hlsl) inside Unity's scriptibal pipeline, and GLSL is mostly the same, but nonetheless it was really fun seeing how customizable you can get with no limiting factor like Unity. I also got to apply some cool math in this portion, where I manipulated my objects with rotation equations using transformation matrices, which I learned from a Graphics Book by Fletcher Dunn.

                            Next, I added a camera system with basic movement + zoom controls. This made navigating the scene possible and laid the groundwork for interacting with 3D space. It was cool seeing how OpenGL has so much support for Input mapping, which was something I was not expecting going into this project.

                            Once I had geometry and movement in place, I added texture support. This included loading images, mapping TextureCoords correctly, and testing with multiple textured cubes. I messed around with a new library stbi_image by Sean Barret. And I learned about Mipmaps and Texture Filtering. I also got to do more work with shaders here, as now I could use the TextureCoords in the color processing.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        This was by far my favourite part of the project, which is probably reflected by just how long this text is. I learned a ton about all the many ways lighting can influence an object. Pretty soon after I implemented a basic Phong lighting model, which I learned all about ambient, diffuse, and specular lights. This was a massive highlight for me, as I am obsessed with math, and the calculations required for these lights are so intriguing and intuitive, I could write a whole essay about how much I loved the math behind these techniques, but I'll save you the time. I spent a ton of time messing around with different values to simulate different materials, which can be found <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/cours/opengl/materials.html" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">here</a>. After that worked, I added lighting maps (Diffuse, and Specular) to my textures, this really opened my eyes on whats possible with materials and this will be my new norm for creating custom textures. I then extended the project to support directional light, point lights, and spotlights—all active in one scene, this again was really fun as I got to delve more into all the linear algebra involved in lighting calculations. Like I said at the start, this portion of the project was absolutely a blast, and lighting is by far my most favorite part of programming.

                        I integrated another library: Assimp to load external 3D models. This allowed me to render more complex assets with their own defined vertices, faces, meshes and materials. This part was actually pretty straight foward for me, as I had already built up a lot of foundations in the project beforehand. It did involve me making two new classes. I even got to add some pretty advanced stuff in here like tangent-space normal mapping and vertex skinning, but I never got to utilize them.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Here I experimented around with depth and stencil testing inside my project. I learned about linear/non-linear depth buffers to calculate Depth value precision, and how the depth value is more precise the closer it is to the near plane. I also had fun with some heavy math operations, as calculating the depth values involved a ton of work with the projection matrix, which I learned from this <a href="https://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_projectionmatrix.html" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">article</a> that explains the matrix in massive detail. Afterwards I played around with Stencil Testing, which is I felt was super valuable experience. There is a bunch of functions already baked in to OpenGL's library, so I had a ton of settings to explore. I ended up using the stencil buffer to outline various objects within my scene. I made an X-ray, and a "selection" action (like selecting something in a RTS) inside an outlining algorithm. There is definetly a lot more I want to explore with these, but I'll save that for when I am making an actual game in this engine.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        This was a really interesting part of the project for me. Although not as math heavy as the previous section, my eyes were still opened by the complexity of blending. I expected this to be a simple chapter, seeing as how the blending equations were quite intuitive and easy to understand, but once I realized how the depth buffer interacts with transparent objects it became much more intriguing. I started off with some simple fragment discarding, using a grass texture (the grass is on a transparent white background). It involved me mapping normals to the texture, and then modifying the way OpenGL samples textures (OpenGL interpolates the border values with the next repeated value of the texture, but since im using transparent values, the top of the texture image gets its transparent value interpolated with the bottom border's solid color value. Which in result gives a white border around the quad. I solved this by setting the Texture Parameter to use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE.). After that I started on actual blending, using a red window texture. The blending equation is actually really simple, fusing the colors based on the alpha value of the source texture and storing it in the color buffer. OpenGL already had a bunch of functions built for this, so it was really easy. What wasn't easy though is how these windows interacted with depth testing. I found that when looking through any transparent window, all other windows behind would vanish. This is because when writing to the depth buffer, the depth test does not check if the fragment has transparency or not, therefore it acts as if it is an opaque object. So to make blending work, I had to draw the most distant window first, so by sorting the objects based on the distance from my camera's position vector, I solved the issue. This was really interesting for me, because there is a ton of ways people have tried to solve this issue for blending. I used a sorted technique, but I did research into the many order independent transparency (OIT) techniques both accurate and approximate - which exposed me to some advanced areas of blending (like using framebuffers, or depth peeling).

                        Even though this was my first OpenGL project, I had a solid foundation going in. I'd already read <em>3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development</em> (Fletcher Dunn) and <em>Foundations of Game Engine Development</em> by Eric Lengyel, as well as a strong theoretical understanding of linear algebra from Gilbert Strang's textbooks. Those books helped a lot with the math side of things.

                        Throughout the project, I followed the LearnOpenGL tutorials. Thanks to the reading I'd done beforehand, the material clicked pretty quickly, and I was able to apply it in my own setup without just copying the code.

                        This was a GPU-heavy project in Unity where I built two separate visualization systems — one for rendering mathematical shapes using a compute shader, and another for animating a fractal hierarchy with Unity's Job System.

                        For the graph system, I wrote a compute shader that positions thousands of cubes on a grid based on different math functions (like sine waves, ripples, spheres, etc). These functions are all GPU-driven, which means they update in real-time without needing the CPU. I also wrote a small HLSL shader that colors each cube based on its position in world space — it's a simple touch, but it makes the shapes look way more dynamic as they animate.

                            The second part of the project was a recursive fractal generator, where I used Unity's Job System + Burst to calculate all the movement and rotations for each "fractal part" in parallel. This kept the performance solid even at high recursion depths. After getting the base animation working, I tweaked the HLSL shader again to vary the colors by fractal level and world position — I was going for something a little more natural and less grid-like than the graph system.
